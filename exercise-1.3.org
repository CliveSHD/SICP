Exercise 1.3: Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

--- Answer ---

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-square-of-larger-two x y z)
  (if (< x y)
      (if (< x z)
          (+ (square y) (square z))
          (+ (square x) (square y)))
      (if (< y z)
          (+ (square x) (square z))
          (+ (square x) (square y)))))
#+END_SRC
