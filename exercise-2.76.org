For generic operations with explicit dispatch adding new operations is easy.
For message passing, adding new types can be done without changing existing code, but adding new operations requires changing all the old code.
Data directed programming actually "solves" the Expression problem by allowing new types *and* new operations to be added without changing existing code.
