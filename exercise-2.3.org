First implementation:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (length segment)
  (sqrt (+ (square (- (x-point (end-segment segment))
                      (x-point (start-segment segment))))
           (square (- (y-point (end-segment segment))
                      (y-point (start-segment segment)))))))

(define (make-rect s-width-1 s-height-1 s-width-2 s-height-2)
  (cons (cons s-width-1 s-height-1) (cons s-width-2 s-height-2)))
(define (width-1 r)
  (car (car r)))
(define (width-2 r)
  (car (cdr r)))
(define (height-1 r)
  (cdr (car r)))
(define (height-2 r)
  (cdr (cdr r)))

(define (perimeter r)
  (* 2 (+ (length (width-1 r))
          (length (height-1 r)))))
        
(define (area r)
  (* (length (width-1 r))
     (length (height-1 r))))
#+END_SRC
